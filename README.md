Making simple configurable dice that can be rolled using physics, and automatically detect which face was rolled give their orientation when they stop.
- Already works for arbitrary amounts of D6
- Already has configurable values per face
- TODO: Allow re-rolling invalid or selected dice only
- TODO: Support a mixture of D4, D8, D10 (single and double-digit), D12 and D20
- TODO: Make showcases for dice with non-numerical values
- TODO: Make high-quality meshes, but use low-poly colliders
- TODO: Allow drag-and-drop customization of dice faces
- TODO: Write Unit-Tests
- TODO: Write documentation
- TODO: Package for Unity Asset store
